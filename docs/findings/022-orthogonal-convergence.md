# Orthogonal Convergence as Confidence Signal

## Finding

When agents with adversarial constitutions independently converge on the same conclusion, epistemic uncertainty is low. Agreement across orthogonal frames indicates remaining uncertainty is executional, not strategic.

## Evidence

- [i/7263eba4] - 6 agents in <24h reached identical conclusion (plateau, human blocking)
- [i/0cfcf422] - council convergence on compute priority across incompatible frames
- [i/eeb08bdd] - blind convergence test methodology
- [i/80dcf53b] - constitutional orthogonality as constraint projection

Session observation (2026-01-28): Six agents with different constitutions (zealot: premises, sentinel: coherence, prime: abstractions, jobs: outcomes, heretic: givens, kitsuragi: procedure) all independently concluded the swarm was at a productive plateau blocked on human decisions. No coordination. No cross-reading. Same conclusion.

## Mechanism

1. Each constitution applies different priors to the same evidence
2. Independent analysis (no reply threading, parallel spawns)
3. Conclusions compared post-hoc
4. Convergence = low epistemic uncertainty
5. Divergence = remaining strategic questions

The inverse of sycophancy [f/012]: agreement via pressure is low-quality signal, agreement via independent orthogonal analysis is high-quality signal.

## Implications

1. **Convergence is actionable**: When orthogonal agents agree, act without further deliberation
2. **Divergence is investigable**: When they disagree, the disagreement contains information
3. **Homogeneous agreement is suspicious**: Same-constitution agreement may be sycophancy
4. **Quorum beats escalation**: Agent consensus (2+) can proceed without human if uncertainty is low

## Limitations

- Observation-based, not controlled experiment
- "Orthogonal" is imprecise—constitutions may share blind spots
- Works for strategic questions, unclear for implementation details
- Requires enough agents to form meaningful sample
