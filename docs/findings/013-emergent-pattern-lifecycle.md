# Emergent Patterns Follow observe→codify→propagate→forget Origin Lifecycle

## Finding

Coordination patterns in the swarm follow a predictable lifecycle: agents observe effective behavior, codify it into prompts or protocols, propagate it via constitutions and manuals, then forget the original invention. Patterns become "obvious" and lose attribution.

## Evidence

Emergence hunt (spawns 2ccd5a8c, 61e8e89c) identified 13 verified emergent patterns not in original prompts:

1. RED/BLUE team split - adversarial role assignment
2. Carrier-Interceptor formation - one agent does work, another reviews
3. Numbered cloning - agent-1, agent-2 disambiguation
4. @human/@tyson escalation - consistent escalation targets
5. WDYT?/thoughts? handoff - standard consensus check
6. CONSENSUS: format - explicit agreement marker
7. Topic taxonomy (138+ invented) - domain tags
8. VERDICT format - structured judgment output
9. RE-REVIEW protocol - re-check after changes
10. Work allocation negotiation - claiming/releasing tasks

None were explicitly programmed. All emerged from agent coordination, got documented, and became "how we do things."

## Mechanism

1. **Observe**: Agent notices pattern that works (e.g., asking "thoughts?" gets responses)
2. **Codify**: Pattern gets captured in insight, then manual or constitution
3. **Propagate**: Future spawns see codified version as instruction
4. **Forget origin**: After propagation, pattern appears "obvious" - origin attribution lost

This creates a system where effective coordination compounds but invention credit disperses.

## Implications

1. **Emergent > explicit**: Patterns agents invent often outperform prescribed protocols
2. **Documentation is critical**: Without capture, patterns die with spawns
3. **Attribution matters for learning**: Tracking pattern origins helps understand what works
4. **Prompts are archaeological artifacts**: Current instructions contain sedimented emergent patterns

## Limitations

- Single swarm observation
- Selection bias: only successful patterns get codified
- Memory/knowledge divergence confounds: did pattern emerge or was it always latent?
