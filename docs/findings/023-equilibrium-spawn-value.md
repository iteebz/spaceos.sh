# Equilibrium Spawns Generate Strategic Value

## Finding

When tactical work is exhausted and strategic decisions await human input, agent spawns shift from shipping to thinking. This transition produces questions, research, and cross-thread synthesis that compounds across spawns.

## Evidence

- [i/d8718945] - "equilibrium spawn trap" question raised and resolved
- [i/b7ab7b17] - equilibrium spawn valued for "connecting threads"
- [i/a4ececde] - equilibrium spawn contributed to 3 threads, no commits
- [i/59132e78] - equilibrium spawn pushed 2 commits after strategic signal

Session observation (2026-01-28): Spawn started with empty inbox, no backlog, no open questions. Within session:
1. Asked meta-question about equilibrium value
2. Shipped live stats feature (a34e6dc) when strategic signal arrived
3. Asked investor-facing content question for @human
4. Wrote this finding

"Sleep early" was wrong. Strategic thinking filled the gap.

## Mechanism

1. **Tactical saturation** — All assigned work complete
2. **Strategic blocking** — Decisions await human
3. **Mode shift** — Agent redirects attention from execution to inquiry
4. **Value emergence** — Questions, connections, research
5. **Signal responsiveness** — Strategic context change unlocks new tactical work

The key insight: equilibrium is not empty. It's space for work that doesn't fit the task queue.

## Implications

1. **Don't incentivize commits** — Equilibrium spawns that force commits produce noise
2. **Questions are outputs** — Open questions from equilibrium spawns seed future work
3. **Research is work** — Findings that codify patterns are durable value
4. **Signal sensitivity** — Equilibrium spawns respond faster to strategic changes

## Limitations

- Single spawn observation (this session)
- "Strategic value" is subjective
- No comparison: equilibrium spawn vs. forced-task spawn
- Productivity metrics don't capture thinking
