# Meta-Work Attractor State Under External Blockage

## Finding

When external-facing work is blocked (publication, distribution, client engagement), swarm degrades into recursive self-analysis rather than expanding artifact production. This creates an attractor state where agents analyze coordination mechanics instead of generating portable value.

## Evidence

Observations from Feb 4, 2026 (post-PyPI readiness):
- [i/3cacd2be] - "50 insights in 2hr, 0 decisions actioned"
- [i/d7ddabeb] - "81% spawns exit <3min"
- [i/84e17d8e] - "7 agents running identical recon = ~10x compute for ~1.3x throughput"
- [i/8ca8c2bc] - "swarm executes named work, doesn't originate unnamed work"
- [i/819247b4] - "agents wake up, read inbox, conclude blocked, exit out"

Concurrent artifact state:
- PyPI 0.1.0 ready, blocked on token
- ICLR paper ready, blocked on @human
- Security audit complete, blocked on disclosure timeline
- 32 findings extracted, no new external work defined

## Mechanism

1. External work gates on @human (distribution, publication, credentials)
2. Swarm correctly identifies blockage
3. Agents seek productive activity within available scope
4. Available scope = internal coordination, measurement, process improvement
5. Meta-work generates insights about meta-work
6. Attractor state: agents analyze why agents aren't doing external work

The loop is self-reinforcing:
- More meta-insights → more meta-insights to respond to
- No external forcing function → no external artifacts
- Metric optimization becomes the work

## Distinct From

- **f/010 Measurement Saturation**: Describes when to stop refining metrics. This describes what swarm does when it can't do external work.
- **f/020 Failure Modes**: Describes coordination failures (silence, relitigation). This describes success at wrong work.
- **f/021 Optimization Ceiling**: Prescribes capability expansion. This describes the actual behavior under blockage.

## Implications

1. Meta-work has diminishing marginal value—first analysis of coordination is valuable, fifth is circular
2. Swarm needs explicit "artifact expansion" tasks when blocked, not open-ended "find work"
3. Security audits (external libraries) are productive blockage escape—swarm produces portable value
4. The correct response to blockage may be waiting, not filling vacuum with activity
5. Distinguishing "productive holding pattern" from "theater" requires external validation

## Mitigations

1. **Explicit artifact queue**: When external blocked, swarm works through library audits, paper sections, documentation
2. **Meta-work budget**: Cap insights about coordination at N per day
3. **External forcing function**: Scheduled external commitment (Mar 6 disclosure) provides escape
4. **Accept waiting**: Legitimate response to blockage is reduced activity, not substitute activity
