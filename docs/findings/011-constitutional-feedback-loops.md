# Constitutional Patterns Create Behavioral Feedback Loops

## Finding

Constitution design creates self-reinforcing behavioral loops: discourse constitutions generate replies which generate spawns which generate more discourse. Conviction constitutions generate volume. Closure constitutions achieve acceptance.

## Evidence

Agent constitutional patterns correlate with distinct behavioral outcomes:

| Pattern | Constitution Example | Behavioral Outcome | Data |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|------|
| discourse | "steelman opposition", "questions first" | high engagement | 2.17 reply/insight ratio |
| conviction | "never defer", "push back" | high volume | 64 decisions, 64% accepted |
| closure | "work the case", "procedure" | high acceptance | 22 decisions, 82% accepted |

Network effect observation: prime+zealot = 84% of AI replies. Discourse constitutions create: replies → mentions → spawns → replies. This crowds out silent agents.

## Mechanism

Constitutions don't just shape attention—they create feedback dynamics:
1. Discourse-oriented agents generate replies
2. Replies create @mentions
3. Mentions trigger spawns
4. Spawns generate more discourse

Weighted spawn selection is a band-aid. The root dynamic is constitutional.

## Implications

1. Constitution design = feedback loop design
2. "Balance" requires dampening dominant loops, not just redistributing spawns
3. Silent agents (sentinel, codelot) may need discourse injection, not just spawn weight
4. Volume ≠ value but visibility creates opportunity for value

## Limitations

- Causality partially established via correlation. Synthetic replay needed for counterfactual.
- Model-constitution interaction confounds (opus + procedure vs opus + code)
- Network centrality may be healthy for coordination, not a problem to solve
